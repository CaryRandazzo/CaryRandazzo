- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaryRandazzo. As an Undergraduate, I achieved a double major in physics and performance piano. As a Masters student, I 
achieved a Masters of Science in Applied Physics. I've also published a book on the subject of habit formation. I first taught myself how to program when I had just become a teenager. I've worked on various projects along the
way that brought my abilities to where they are today. I've worked on web development projects, used server side scripting to build an application
that processes data files and calculates scoring statistics, took several university courses on programming, worked on several game
development projects that required extensive learning and use of C#, project planning and management, object oriented programming, and organization.
I've also worked on various other projects, but I believe my training and research projects have had the most impact. Those projects include
research on electromagnetic pulses in the atmosphere(physics and programming) and my project on Data Quality Optimization with Machine Learning
for CERN's ATLAS experiment (Thesis in partial fulfillment of my Masters in Applied Physics).

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Many things of this world. Data Science, Statistics, Physics, Engineering, Building things, Machine Learning,
Programming, Efficiency, Self Improvement and Mastery, Psychology, Martial Arts, Electronics, Language Learning, Music Performance,
entrepreneurship, writing, travelling, and cultures of the world.

In the field of Data Science I also have many interests, but my background and current interests include:
Anomaly Detection, Predictive NLP and Information Extraction, Scientific Computing and Data Science applied to the STEM fields,
Weather Forecast Models and optimization using Machine Learning, Stock Market prediction, Problem Solving, and more.

- 🌱 I’m currently in process of finishing my Masters Thesis which requires extensive skills in linux, collaboration, data preparation,
python, deep learning, machine learning, project planning, data analysis, statistical methods, anomaly detection, big data, sql databases,
experimentation, and research on data quality.

- 💞️ I’m would be open to collaborating on various projects. The projects of most interest would be in areas similar to what I've
mentioend previously in this profile.
